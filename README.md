# Safe pattern generation for multi-stage programming

## Introduction

This project is a library, built on top of MetaOCaml, that implements the type-safe generation of arbitrary pattern-matching expressions. The dissertation abstract of this work is provided below, as an introduction:

> Multi-stage programming is a metaprogramming paradigm, allowing for the generation of programs guaranteed to be well-typed and well-scoped. This generation may be used to produce optimised versions of algorithms, such as performing unrolling of a list-mapping function. This function, like many in functional programming languages, makes use of pattern-matching expressions, however, current multi-stage programming languages do not support the type-safe generation of arbitrary pattern-matching expressions.
>
> This work introduces a domain-specific language (dsl) for the compositional description and generation of pattern-matching expressions, an associated type system to restrict generation to valid, type-safe code, and combinators for the construction of statically unknown patterns using this dsl. This work is implemented as a library built on top of the MetaOCaml extension of OCaml.
>
> The pattern system presented provides mechanisms to generate a broad class of pattern-matching expressions, is extensible to support many other pattern types, and provides a simple, ergonomic interface for use, with concise, informative error messages. The approach taken is also sufficiently general to be applicable to alternative multi-stage programming systems.

## Usage

For OCaml, BER MetaOCaml N114 is supported:

```bash
❯ ocaml --version
The OCaml toplevel, version 4.14.1
❯ opam switch    
#  switch      compiler                   description
→  4.14.1+BER  ocaml-variants.4.14.1+BER  4.14.1+BER
   default     ocaml.5.1.0                default
```

For Haskell, GHC 9.2.8 is supported:

```bash
❯ ghc --version                            
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 9.2.8
```

### Pattern generation library

Navigate to the `pattern_generation` directory. Then:

- To run `nmap`, `sum` or `tail` generation, uncomment the desired function in `bin/main.ml` and run:

```bash
dune exec ./bin/main.exe
```

- To benchmark the list unrollings, run:

```bash
dune build @unrolling
```

- To run the examples from the dissertation, run:

```bash
dune exec ./lib/generators/report_examples.exe
```

- To run the pattern DSL examples, run:

```bash
dune exec ./lib/utilities/pat_playground/pat_playground.exe
```


### Haskell Patterns

Navigate to the `haskell_patterns` directory. Then:

- To use the full Rhiger patterns:

```bash
ghci rhiger_full.hs
```
- To use the simple Rhiger patterns:

```bash
ghci rhiger_simple.hs
```

- To use the untyped `sum_n` generator:

```bash
runghc untyped_sum.hs
```

### Power specialisation example

Navigate to the `power_example` directory. Then run:

```bash
dune exec ./power.exe
```

## Configuration Notes

### Configuring Dune

- Download BER MetaOCaml as instructed.
- Install `dune`,
- Install `ocamlfind` to be able to find the `metaocaml` library.

### Configuring Development Environment in VSCode

- Install `ocaml-lsp-server` and `merlin`.
- Add in `settings.json` the following to make the OCaml LSP server use dot-merlin files: 
```json
{
    "ocaml.server.args": [
        "--fallback-read-dot-merlin"
    ]
}
```
- Use sth like the script below to generate initial `.merlin` file for every directory with source files
```bash
folders=(all/dir/with/file)

for f in ${folders[@]}
do
    dune ocaml dump-dot-merlin $f | sed '/^INDEX/d' > ./$f/.merlin && echo "REC" >> ./$f/.merlin;
done
```
- At the top level, add a `.merlin` file with the result of the command above + the following to add support for Metaprogramming things (see [article here](https://qiita.com/keigoi/items/c9f43309312978acf05a)).
```
EXT meta
FLG -open Trx
